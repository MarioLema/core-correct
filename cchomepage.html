          <p class="lead">
            Osteopathy is a person-centred manual therapy that aims to enable
            patients to respond and adapt to changing circumstances and to live
            well.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Osteopaths are trained in therapeutic approaches that are suitable
            for a broad range of individuals of all ages, including pregnant
            women, children and babies.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Osteopathic care is delivered through a range of interventions,
            which may include onward referral, health management advice, manual
            therapy, exercise therapy and others. Osteopaths adapt their
            therapeutic approach depending on the individual needs of the
            patient and their presenting complaint. Manual therapy techniques
            employed may include articulation and manipulation of joints and
            soft tissues.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Osteopaths have been regulated by statute since 1993 by the General
            Osteopathic Council (GOsC) and may refer to conditions for which
            medical supervision should be sought if they hold convincing
            evidence of the efficacy of their treatments.

          <h2 class="container-header">What to Expect?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            When you attend your first consultation we will investigate the
            source of the problem by asking you some simple questions about the
            history of your complaint and any other factors that are relevant to
            the problem. We’ll want to know about your past health, and any
            injuries or investigations you may have had as far back as you might
            remember.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            We will carry out a full examination before making a diagnosis and
            deciding on the most appropriate treatment for you. This will
            usually include an assessment of your posture, and identifying ease
            or restriction of movement in relevant parts of your body.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            The format may vary but most patients will probably be asked to
            undress to their underwear for this part of the examination as
            subtleties of contour and movement are necessary for an accurate
            assessment.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Depending on our findings at this stage, further tests may be
            required similar to those carried out by general practitioners, such
            as reflexes, blood pressure or using a stethoscope to listen to your
            heart or lungs. In some cases it may be necessary to refer you to
            your GP or a specialist for further investigation i.e. X-ray or MRI.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            You will be given a provisional diagnosis and our view of whether
            osteopathic treatment can overcome or help to alleviate the symptoms
            and the treatment approach will be explained. With your consent,
            your first consultation will usually be concluded with the most
            appropriate treatment for that day.

            <div class="massage-text">
              <p>
                Sports massage is a form of massage involving the manipulation
                of soft tissue to benefit a person engaged in regular physical
                activity. Soft tissue is connective tissue that has not hardened
                into bone and cartilage; it includes skin, muscles, tendons,
                ligaments and fascia (a form of connective tissue that lines and
                ensheathes the other soft tissues).
              </p>
              <p>
                Sports massage is designed to assist in correcting problems and
                imbalances in soft tissue that are caused from repetitive and
                strenuous physical activity and trauma. The application of
                sports massage, prior to and after exercise, may enhance
                performance, aid recovery and prevent injury.

            <h4>THERAPEUTIC MASSAGE</h4>
            <div class="massage-text">
              <p>
                Therapeutic Massage is a combination of Relaxation Massage and
                Remedial Massage to not only relax your whole body and at the
                same time, work through some of the muscle issues or “tight
                spots” you may be experiencing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Massage therapy aims to improve your circulation, which enhances
                the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to muscle cells and helps
                remove waste products or reduce swelling. These circulatory
                effects of massage may have value in the treatment of some
                inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Massage therapy induces a relaxation response, which lowers your
                heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure; plus boosts your
                immune system; and generally decreases the physical effects of
                stress

              <p>
                Deep tissue massage therapy is similar to Swedish massage, but
                the deeper pressure is beneficial in releasing chronic muscle
                tension. The focus is on the deepest layers of muscle tissue,
                tendons and fascia (the protective layer surrounding muscles,
                bones and joints).

                Pilates is a method of exercise that consists of low-impact
                flexibility and muscular strength and endurance movements.
                Pilates emphasizes proper postural alignment, core strength and
                muscle balance. Pilates is named for its creator, Joseph
                Pilates, who developed the exercises in the 1920s.

                Grooving to the beats of salsa, flamenco, and merengue music
                feels more like a dance party than a workout, which is exactly
                what makes Zumba so popular. The Latin-inspired dance workout is
                one of the most popular group exercise classes in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                The high-energy classes are set to upbeat music and feature
                choreographed dance numbers that you might see in a nightclub.
                You don’t need to be a great dancer to feel welcome in a Zumba
                class. With the tag line, “Ditch the Workout, Join the Party,”
                the classes emphasize moving to the music and having a good
                time, no rhythm required.
